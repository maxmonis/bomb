## BOMB

### Description

This is a game for 2-4 players. There are no logins, so to start gameplay the user simply selects how many players will participate and chooses a name for each player.

### Gameplay

Each turn can take a maximum of 30 seconds, and a countdown is displayed on the screen.

The first player selects either a movie or an actor, using the search bar.

Once they've made a selection, play continues and player 2 must select. If the previous selection was a movie, they must name an actor who appeared in that movie. If the previous selection was an actor, they must name a movie in which that actor played. Gameplay continues this way.

If a player runs out of time or clicks the "Challenge" button, the previous player must make a selection. If their selection is valid (meaning movie and actor match), the challenging player receives a letter (the letters a B, O, M, and B, in that order). If the selection is invalid or they run out of time, the challenged player receives a letter.

Players are eliminated if they've spelled out BOMB. The final player who was not eliminated is the winner.

A list of actors and a list of movies is displayed on the screen. Actors and movies cannot be reused at any time.

### Technical Overview

This first iteration only allows local play on a single device and has no external dependencies.
